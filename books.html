            This book examines major theological fitnas that have affected Sunni Islamic creed, with a
            particular focus on the Indian Subcontinent. It explains why correct ʿaqīdah is the foundation
            of Islam and how deviations at the creed level carry serious consequences.

        <p>
            Using classical Sunni scholarship as its reference point, the book analyzes contested beliefs,
            clarifies orthodox positions, and presents the scholarly response rooted in continuity rather
            than innovation.
