            <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
            
            <h3>His Birth and Early Life</h3>
            <p>Imam Ahmad Raza Khan was born on 10th Shawwal 1272 AH (14th June 1856) in Bareilly, India. His full name was Ahmad Raza Khan bin Naqi Ali Khan. He came from a family known for knowledge and piety.</p>
            
            <p>His father, Maulana Naqi Ali Khan, was his first and most important teacher. From a very young age, Ahmad Raza showed signs of great intelligence and a sharp memory. He could understand difficult concepts quickly.</p>

            <h3>His Education</h3>
            <p>He completed his basic Islamic education at a young age. By the time he was 13 or 14 years old, he had studied most of the traditional Islamic sciences. These included:</p>
            
            <div class="list-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>Quran and its explanation (Tafsir)</li>
                    <li>Hadith (sayings of the Prophet ﷺ)</li>
                    <li>Islamic law (Fiqh)</li>
                    <li>Arabic grammar and language</li>
                    <li>Logic and philosophy</li>
                    <li>Beliefs and theology (Aqidah)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>He received permission to teach and issue religious verdicts (fatwas) at a very young age. This was unusual, but his teachers recognized his deep understanding.</p>

            <h3>His Teachers</h3>
            <p>His main teacher was his father, Maulana Naqi Ali Khan. He also studied under other scholars of his time. He benefited from the chain of knowledge that connected him to the great scholars of the past.</p>

            <h3>His Character and Personality</h3>
            <p>Those who knew him described him as humble, kind, and deeply devoted to Allah. He was soft-spoken and treated everyone with respect. He was known for his love of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, which was clear in his writings and poetry.</p>

            <p>He spent most of his time in worship, study, writing, and answering questions from Muslims who came to him for guidance. He lived a simple life and did not seek fame or wealth.</p>

            <h3>The Time He Lived In</h3>
            <p>Imam Ahmad Raza lived during the time of British rule in India. It was a difficult period for Muslims. Their education system was changing, and many new ideas were coming from the West.</p>

            <p>At the same time, there were groups spreading beliefs that went against traditional Islamic teachings. Some were denying the honor of the Prophet ﷺ. Others were changing the meanings of Quran and Hadith in wrong ways.</p>

            <p>In this situation, Imam Ahmad Raza worked hard to protect the correct beliefs of Islam and guide common Muslims.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>His Service to Islam</h2>

            <h3>Protecting Islamic Beliefs</h3>
            <p>One of his main tasks was to protect correct Islamic beliefs. He wrote books and gave fatwas (religious rulings) to clarify what Islam truly teaches.</p>

            <p>He opposed ideas that disrespected the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ or reduced his special position. He also defended the practice of seeking blessings through righteous people and visiting their graves, which is part of traditional Sunni Islam.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> He did not invent new beliefs. He simply explained and defended what mainstream Sunni scholars had always taught. His work was a continuation of the classical tradition.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>His Role as a Jurist (Faqih)</h3>
            <p>Imam Ahmad Raza answered thousands of questions on Islamic law. People from all over India and beyond would write to him asking about their daily problems. He would give clear answers based on Quran, Hadith, and the rulings of past scholars.</p>

            <p>His collection of fatwas is called "Fatawa Razawiyyah." It contains answers to over 6,000 questions and fills about 30 volumes. This is one of the largest collections of fatwas in the Hanafi school of thought.</p>

            <h3>Guiding Common Muslims</h3>
            <p>He did not only write for scholars. He also wrote simple guides for ordinary Muslims. He wanted everyone to understand their religion properly.</p>

            <p>He wrote about:</p>
            <div class="list-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>How to pray correctly</li>
                    <li>How to fast during Ramadan</li>
                    <li>Rules of marriage and family life</li>
                    <li>Business and trade in Islam</li>
                    <li>How to celebrate Islamic occasions properly</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>His Writings</h3>
            <p>Imam Ahmad Raza wrote more than 1,000 books and booklets in Arabic, Persian, and Urdu. Some were long and detailed. Others were short and simple.</p>

            <p>He also wrote beautiful poetry in praise of the Prophet ﷺ. His poems are still recited in gatherings around the world. His most famous collection of poetry is called "Hadaiq-e-Bakhshish."</p>

            <p>Through his writings, millions of Muslims learned their religion correctly. His books are still studied today in Islamic schools and universities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>His Knowledge Beyond Religious Sciences</h2>

            <p>Many people know Imam Ahmad Raza as a religious scholar. But he was also knowledgeable in other fields. This made him a complete intellectual of his time.</p>

            <h3>Mathematics</h3>
            <p>He had deep knowledge of mathematics. He could solve complex problems that even professional mathematicians found difficult. He wrote books on geometry and algebra.</p>

            <p>In his time, very few religious scholars understood advanced mathematics. But Imam Ahmad Raza mastered it. This skill helped him in calculating prayer times, inheritance shares, and other matters that require math.</p>

            <h3>Astronomy</h3>
            <p>He studied the movements of the sun, moon, and stars. He wrote about how to determine Islamic dates and prayer times accurately.</p>

            <p>His work in astronomy was recognized by scholars in this field. He corrected mistakes that were common in the calendars of his time.</p>

            <h3>Logic and Philosophy</h3>
            <p>He was skilled in logic and rational thinking. This helped him win debates and prove his points clearly. When people argued with him using logic, he could respond in the same way.</p>

            <p>He also studied philosophy so he could respond to those who used philosophy to attack Islamic beliefs.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> His knowledge in these fields gave him authority not just among religious people, but also among educated people of his time. It showed that Islamic scholarship is not narrow or limited. A true scholar of Islam can master many subjects.</p>

            <h2>Historical Incidents Showing His Brilliance</h2>

            <div class="incident-box">
                <h3>The Famous Mathematics Problem - Dr. Zia-ud-Din's Question</h3>
                
                <p>One of the most famous incidents involves a British mathematics professor named Dr. Zia-ud-Din Ahmad. He was a well-known mathematician in India during that time.</p>

                <p>Dr. Zia-ud-Din was working on a difficult mathematical problem. He tried to solve it for a long time but could not. He showed it to other professors and mathematicians, but no one could solve it either.</p>

                <p>Someone suggested that he show the problem to Imam Ahmad Raza Khan in Bareilly. Dr. Zia-ud-Din was surprised. He thought, "How can a religious scholar solve a mathematics problem that trained mathematicians cannot solve?"</p>

                <p>But he decided to visit anyway. When he reached Bareilly and presented the problem, Imam Ahmad Raza looked at it carefully. He thought for a short time, then wrote down the complete solution.</p>

                <p>Dr. Zia-ud-Din checked the answer. He was amazed. The solution was perfectly correct. He could not believe that someone solved in minutes what had taken him months of struggle.</p>

                <p>When he asked how this was possible, Imam Ahmad Raza explained the method clearly. Dr. Zia-ud-Din realized he was not just meeting a religious scholar, but a brilliant mathematician as well.</p>

                <p>This incident became famous. It showed that Imam Ahmad Raza's mind was not limited to religious books. He had mastered many branches of knowledge.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="incident-box">
                <h3>His Speed in Writing Fatwas</h3>
                
                <p>People noticed that Imam Ahmad Raza could write fatwas very quickly. Sometimes he would answer complex questions in just a few minutes.</p>

                <p>One day, a group of students wanted to test this. They brought him several difficult questions all at once. They thought he would need hours or days to answer.</p>

                <p>He read all the questions carefully. Then he started writing. He answered all of them in one sitting, one after another, without looking at any book for reference. Each answer was complete, clear, and backed by proper evidence from Quran, Hadith, and scholarly opinions.</p>

                <p>The students were shocked. They realized his memory was extraordinary and his understanding was very deep.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="incident-box">
                <h3>Correcting a Famous Scholar's Mistake</h3>
                
                <p>Once, a famous scholar from another city wrote a book. In it, he made a small mistake in understanding a verse of the Quran.</p>

                <p>When Imam Ahmad Raza read the book, he noticed the error immediately. He wrote a respectful letter to the scholar, pointing out the mistake and explaining the correct understanding.</p>

                <p>The scholar received the letter and checked the classical books of Tafsir. He realized Imam Ahmad Raza was right. He publicly thanked him and corrected his book in the next edition.</p>

                <p>This shows two things: Imam Ahmad Raza's sharp eye for detail, and his respectful way of correcting others.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="incident-box">
                <h3>Memorizing Books After One Reading</h3>
                
                <p>Students who studied with him reported that he had an amazing memory. If he read a book once with full attention, he could remember its contents for years.</p>

                <p>Sometimes in a discussion, he would quote exact lines from books he had read many years ago. People would later check those books and find that his memory was completely accurate.</p>

                <p>This gift of memory helped him greatly in his work. He could bring together knowledge from many different books when writing his answers and explanations.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>His Legacy and Influence</h2>

            <p>Imam Ahmad Raza Khan passed away on 25th Safar 1340 AH (28th October 1921) in Bareilly. He was 64 years old.</p>

            <p>His influence did not end with his death. His students and their students continued his work. Today, millions of Muslims around the world follow the teachings he explained and defended.</p>

            <p>His books are still studied. His poetry is still recited. His fatwas are still used as reference. Islamic schools and universities teach his works.</p>

            <h3>A Balanced View</h3>
            <p>Some people praise him too much and make up stories that never happened. Others criticize him unfairly without studying his actual works.</p>

            <p>The truth is that he was a serious scholar who worked very hard to serve Islam. He had deep knowledge in many fields. He wrote clearly and taught with wisdom. He defended what he believed was the true path of Sunni Islam.</p>
