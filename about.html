            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh. My name is Ishfaq dar, and I am a Sunni Muslim who follows the Hanafi madhhab. This website is a humble effort to share Islamic knowledge in a clear, accessible way for ordinary Muslims who seek to understand their faith more deeply.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not a scholar, nor do I claim any special authority in Islamic knowledge. Rather, I am a student of Islam who has spent years learning from qualified teachers and reading the works of our righteous predecessors. What I share here is what I have learned from those who came before me.
            </p>

            <h2>My Journey to Islamic Knowledge</h2>
            
            <h3>Early Years</h3>
            <p>
                <!-- EDIT THIS SECTION - Share your personal story -->
                Like many Muslims, I grew up with a basic understanding of Islam—knowing how to pray, fast, and recite Qur'an—but without deep knowledge of why we do what we do or how Islamic law is derived. I had many questions but few clear answers.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I grew older, I encountered conflicting information from various sources: different opinions online, heated debates in the community, and confusion about which scholars to trust. This led me on a journey to understand Islam properly, from its foundations.
            </p>

            <h3>Learning from Scholars</h3>
            <p>
                <!-- EDIT THIS SECTION - Describe your learning journey -->
                Alhamdulillah, I was blessed to connect with knowledgeable teachers who taught me the importance of following the madhhabs and understanding Islamic methodology. I learned that Islam is not about picking and choosing opinions based on convenience, but about submitting to Allah's guidance through the framework our scholars have preserved.
            </p>
            <p>
                I studied the basics of Hanafi fiqh, Hadith sciences, and Islamic theology (aqidah) under the guidance of qualified teachers. This transformed my understanding of Islam from a collection of rules to a comprehensive way of life rooted in divine wisdom.
            </p>

            <h3>Why I Write</h3>
            <p>
                <!-- THIS SECTION - Explain your motivation -->
                I noticed that many Muslims today face the same confusion I once experienced. There is so much information available, but very little clarity. People are told to "just follow Quran and Sunnah" without understanding that this requires deep knowledge and proper methodology.
            </p>
            <p>
                I felt a responsibility to share what I have learned in simple language, helping others avoid the confusion and doubt I once struggled with. This website is my small contribution to making authentic Islamic knowledge accessible to everyone.

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>My Approach to Teaching</h2>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>My methodology is based on these principles:</strong></p>
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clarity over complexity:</strong> Islamic knowledge should be accessible. I avoid unnecessary jargon and explain concepts in everyday language.</li>
                <li><strong>Following the scholars:</strong> I base my writings on the established positions of the Hanafi madhhab and the broader Sunni tradition, not personal opinion.</li>
                <li><strong>Humility and respect:</strong> I acknowledge that I am a student, not a scholar. I treat those who disagree with respect and avoid polemics.</li>
                <li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> Everything I share is grounded in the Qur'an, authentic Sunnah, and the consensus of qualified scholars.</li>
                <li><strong>Service to the Ummah:</strong> This work is for the sake of Allah alone. I do not seek fame, money, or recognition—only His acceptance.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Why the Hanafi Madhhab?</h2>
            <p>
                I follow the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence because it is the madhhab I was raised in and the one I have studied most deeply. The Hanafi madhhab represents the methodology of Imam Abu Hanifa (may Allah have mercy on him), one of the greatest scholars in Islamic history.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I respect all four Sunni madhhabs (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali) and recognize them as valid paths to understanding Allah's commands. The differences between them are matters of scholarly interpretation, not fundamental disagreements about faith.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following a madhhab does not mean blind imitation—it means learning from qualified scholars who have dedicated their lives to understanding the Qur'an and Sunnah. It is a path of humility and wisdom.
